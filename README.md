# github-repo-creation

**Function of this automation:**

-> Enter a repo name that doesn't exist in your GitHub Organization then it creates a repo with the given name, then later it is going to open up your installed slack application and create a channel with the same 
   repo name that created by you, then it's going to send a confirmation message in that channel. After this step it also sends a email confirmation to you slack logged email (taken from your profile).

-> After testing a lot of times 'delete_unwanted_github_repo.xaml' is going to login to your github account in microsoft edge and then delete the repos which you don't want to use.
